anxious that she's not going to get a job.", "She started talking about how she sort of been sold the stream that you can go and get a Humanities degree and you'll get a job afterwards.", "That was a dream.", "She had always been sold.", "She had a whole lot of people getting her bad advice.", "It's just factually inaccurate.", "It just is not the least because in her first three years, she got a one degree and then she spent another year getting another degree instead of graduating early because she recognized that she couldn't get a job with the first degree.", "This is the conversation.",

problem.", "I could recognize while it was happening that she was really just upset and looking for an outlet for being upset, but I couldn't stop also not being angry about her misrepresenting our conversations and the conversations.", "She has had with a lot of good people who had advised her in one way or another that there are three things to consider.", "Also when one is getting an education", "I think I feel guilty that I just can't handle all of it.", "But there's also a sense in which I acknowledge that I have limits and I seem to be running into some of them and ask it

close to a suicide attempt is a threat to kill herself.", "I think we were outside of the crisis.", "I have injured emotions.", "I think that's the primary source of what's been going on, but I don't.", "It's sort of like the more she goes back to being normal that part isn't knowledge.", "So there's no sense in which I want to wallow in it or do well on it or hold her accountable for it.",

question.", "I didn't really feel like she could know but then we had the conversation where she asked me directly if we were okay, so I sort of put it out there anyway, because there is a sense in which itself is an act of trust for me trust is in part built by trusting a little more than might be reasonable and seeing what happens.", "You can build a considerable amount of trust in that way but in smaller risks.", "I think it's too soon to tell whether she actually can or not, but she could in that moment.", "Acknowledge that of course, I would be hurt by those things.", "I don't think she thought about it very much.", "She said she hadn't really thought about her coming close to killing herself hurting me.", "She was most mostly just happy with herself for not having killed herself.", "All right, that's pretty okay, but it is also missing the effects on me and on everyone else in both of our families."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["I realize I was thinking about this

them to carry too much.", "And then how do I balance all that with Tanya's name or seems needs at the same time?", "It's been a very hard optimization problem.", "The end result is that her father finally visited 2 weeks ago, but she hadn't wanted to see him before then and basically just wouldn't let him come.", "He wouldn't talk to him either.", "So it is like the burden on me.", "The burden is on me to communicate how she's doing.", "And then also tell these people who love her and her family's impulse is always just to show up and be there which in some ways is a really good impulse and in some ways, maybe not a great impulse.", "I think mostly it's really good.", "A little planning.", "Sometimes a good thing.", "It's how these people who really love her and want to be there for her.", "That's not what she wants right now.", "Even will not being sure that what she wants should count right now.", "So clearly taking some of her desires off the table is reasonable.", "I have two brothers and sisters and particularly.", "My sisters really want to be there for me and take care of me.", "But again, it's like at what point as far as the time issues we're getting into half a dozen

continuity of the area across people.", "It's just really bad.", "The whole thing is just really bad.", "There's often not an extent to which just talking about it helps sometimes for me knowledge is a really useful particularly when you get to the 3rd or 4th thing that's worn off.", "Now I'm just passing on Grief to someone else.", "Yeah, the whole thing has been pretty complicated in terms of our families.", "On another level it becomes another logistical challenge, which is I guess who I'm talking about it even though it's also a lot of other things.", "You're so many other logistical

said that you didn't tell them about her going to the bathroom.", "I said that you didn't tell me that either you said trust.", "What was it?", "You said about the trust I was struck by that."]},

about it.", "The only thing I think that plays into that one is that I didn't start seeing you until the end of January or February somewhere in there as just us.", "So before then there was an extent to which I didn't talk about something because we were still doing in theory something like couples counseling."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["We were meeting just us, but it was still not the because I've only met with you and Tanya three times.", "So it was just I guess the context wasn't as clear but it was just us."]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["No, sorry.", "It was just you and I but the patient was a relationship at the time in an official capacity and not me.", "That changed some of the things that I talked about like I didn't tell you about Tanya having this emotional affair until you were treating just me."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["So I'm feeling like with the more trust.", "You can share more.", "Is it for Lee how I will talk to you about about it or feeling more trusting how we'll handle it together."]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["That would be a reasonable feeling.", "I'm not sure I have any reason that's anywhere is reasonable is that", "I don't know as I have an articulated reason for it, which is interesting.", "I think it relates to some knowledge of or trust in response what response I will get immediately and where it will go from there.", "I think."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["And how might it go wrong?"]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["On the one hand and this is not as much an issue in our relationship, but the other person may not

mother about tonya's relationship with his Professor.", "I don't know how my mother would respond but it could go that my mother is angry or hurt and then I have to deal with those also and that hasn't helped me at all."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["So you said mitigated not alleviated?"]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["Yeah that has to do with there's some amount of trust I put in you

how some people are doing their jobs."]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["Absolutely, so that's why I said change that because it's not like just you having this job makes me trust you.", "In a sense, that's a way of starting to put trust in you.", "I feel like you've been very helpful to me and you've done your job very well.", "And so I can trust you much more in some sense."]}, {"speaker": 1,

different category than Tanya's illness and the extent to which she was suicidal, but somehow you see that a similar.", "Maybe I'm not sure."]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["Yeah, it's not like I haven't told anyone that she's suicidal.", "But how many details do they need?", "I feel like the details drive it home or make it hurt more.", "They make it more real.", "Suicidal is kind of a fairly big word."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["As is abuse a lot of things the devil is in the details."]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["Right in both cases.", "We've talked before about me having some sort of Need for control and need to protect other people and take care of other people.", "I feel like the same thing is going both second stanzas in a sense.", "I am protecting my mother and I am protecting Tanya in the case of Tanya wanting to kill herself.", "I'm not protecting Tanya as much because", "I don't think there's that much more conveyed about her state in some way but the impact on my mother or whoever would be greater with more details."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["It's interested because I was thinking that when you share something that you really need help with your actually assuming that the person would be able to deal with it better than you right.", "I'm not saying you feel about way but that's sort of the reason about talking about this with someone.", "It's too much for you.", "You're helping though actually help you deal with it."]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["Yeah, I feel like you're either hoping that they can handle the same circumstance better or that the circumstances less like you somehow the only person I talk to you about Tanya's relationship is my best friend and that's because Tanya almost told him or told him most of it but not enough so he called me and said what's going on but then I was in this position position of do I sit there and blunder about what's going on or I could tell him and that seemed clearly less bad, but there's a sense in which it's not so much that he could handle it better, but it wasn't as painful for him if that makes sense.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, I think that's right.", "I think what I'm doing is just quibbling a little bit about your suggestion or in suggesting a way in which they might be able to handle it better.", "But of course the place you're taking it back to you is that I currently have been able to handle things better than other people."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["You're not sure of certain details like Tanya taking the plastic bag into the bathroom.", "You're thinking that you can handle it somewhat that somehow no one else could it would be too much?"]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["Yeah, there's also a sense in which how many people need to handle that simultaneously."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["Someone who is helping you would need to I'm not even talking simply about me.", "But anyone you would rely on to help you through this."]},

bringing a logical formula.", "There are this many people and I can only have this many conversations usually people are closer to one sibling or two siblings than others.", "That's who you talk to you about things that you need help with or that you share.", "There is a way in which you go into this very logical or there's a way you go into this.", "Dirty logical formula about time management.", "It's almost like kind of information management or an information flow management.", "Like that's how you think about it rather than I'm so overwhelmed.", "You can't believe this just happened.", "This is just catastrophic.", "I don't know what to do."]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["You don't think those two are the same thing.", "My response is exactly the second one, but I know how to manage information and I know how to do these logistical things.", "So I go to those things because they're so lovable or closer to solvable.", "What do I do that?", "My wife want to kill herself?", "You can on the Practical problems and they are the practical problems of who needs to know.", "What and what do I need to do to make it from one day to the next?"]}, {"speaker": 1,

mind?", "I can't think of the word something about taking care of it or how are you going to sort of sort of you being in charge of this feeling defacto and charge I have to say families are different

be much more likely to be the parents and not the spouse.", "Especially for people in their twenties would be managing this like all of it."]}, {"speaker": 2, "dialogue": ["Eventually, I just asked my mother to manage information flow to my siblings and I just talked to her I guess on some level I agree."]}, {"speaker": 1, "dialogue": ["I was sort of speaking to a norm.", "There's not going to be a right about the norm.", "I guess it makes me think about I don't know if you are Tanya said this you were born 40 something about the way you guys manage.", "It makes me think about keeping more in
